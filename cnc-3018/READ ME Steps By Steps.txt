When Engraving:
1. After adjusting the machine, open the engraving file to check where the zero point is, usually at the lower left corner.
2. Locate the machine to the lower left corner of the workpiece first, then lower the cutter and the spindle must be turned on. Slow it down when the cutter is close to the workpiece, gently adjust it to the surface. 
3. Important! After lowering the cutter, click "XY zero " and "Z zero". Then you can click "start" to engrave. 

Tips: It is better to run the machine without any workpiece first. Test it before you start formal engraving.
